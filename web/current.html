      <h2>Current Release - 0.1</h2>
      
      <p>
        This release is in true 'release early, release often' form.  It comes
        with a number of caveats that you should be aware of.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While the goal of Insurance is to be a general tool, this release
        primarily focuses on the Rails runner.  While you can currently use
        Insurance on any project with a test/unit based test suite, it's not
        as simple as the Rails runner.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Insurance requires Ruby 1.8.3.  Lots of people aren't using 1.8.3 yet,
        so you will need to have this installed.  If you're worried about making
        the switch, I suggest just installing 1.8.3 in your home directory.
        Then, when you want to use it, just prepend its bin/ directory to your
        PATH.  You can then install rubygems, rails, etc. and the 1.8.3 based
        versions of everything will be used so long as its first in your PATH.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In order to gain increases in speed, Insurance only traces Ruby's LINE
        events.  This means that there might be an occasional construct 
        (specifically one statement that spans multiple lines) that will get
        marked as not being run when it has been run.  These should be fairly
        easy to spot when browsing the report, however I would appreciate it if
        you mail me with any constructs that get mis-analyzed so I can handle
        them in post processing.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I seem to have an issue where Insurance will cause a passing test to
        if the test is using mock objects from Rails's test/mocks directory.
        I'm still investigating this.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you want to be super helpful, you can run Insurance and report to
        me the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The time it takes for your tests to run normally vs the time it
        takes them to run with Insurance.</li>
        <li>If Insurance mis-analyzes any constructs (as discussed above)
        what are those constructs?</li>
        <li>If Insurance causes any tests to fail or error, do they use mock
        objects?  If not, what does the test look like?</li>
      </ul>
