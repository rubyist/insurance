      <h2>What is Insurance?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Insurance is a test coverage analysis tool for Ruby.  Insurance uses
        tracing, similar to rcov/Coverage, but is written as a C extension to
        gain speed.  In general tests, Insurance runs 4 to 6 times slower than
        a normal run of the test suite.  Compared with pure Ruby tracing
        (via <code>set_trace_func</code>) this is a tremendous increase in
        speed.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Insurance currently does only line based coverage analysis, though there
        are plans to add other types of analysis in future releases.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Insurance also includes a runner script to make doing coverage analysis
        of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> applications extremely
        easy.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What is required to run Insurance?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Insurance requires Ruby 1.8.3 and the Syntax package.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insurance does contain a C extension, so you'll need to be able to build
        one. Insurance builds and works great on Linux, BSD, and OSX. I do not
        know anything about using Ruby on Windows, or building C extensions on
        Windows. If you're a Windows user and know how to get this packaged up,
        please contact me. Otherwise I have no plans to acquire, install, and
        learn Windows in order to package Insurance for it.
      </p>
